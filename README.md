# Dynamic User Directory

A dynamic user directory that fetches user data from the Random User Generator API ([https://randomuser.me/](https://randomuser.me/)), displays it on a webpage, and allows users to view additional details in a modal window. It includes features like search functionality and navigation between users in the modal.
